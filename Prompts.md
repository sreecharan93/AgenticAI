## User Prompt

- The attached file contains a survey of researchers in the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) and adjacent areas answering questions about their definition Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, Collaborative Learning, whether those are different from Cooperative Learning, and what they think the future of the field is. First, conduct a qualitative (thematic) analysis of the responses in the column titled "How do you define Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) in one sentence?" and output the themes that the responses fall into. Translate any non-English responses to English before doing the above. For each of the themes, provide a detailed description of the theme and the exact number of responses that fall into that theme. Provide the list of codes identified from the thematic analysis and provide a codebook mapping each of themes and their descriptions to the codes that fall under each theme. Finally output the full survey data of the analyzed column along with the associated codes.

- The process for conducting the thematic analysis is described below - 

- Codebook Development
  - Generate initial codes independently:
    - Each coder reads through the data, identifying and labeling relevant segments of text.
    - Create concise code names and clear definitions for each code.
  - Compare and refine codes:
    - Meet to discuss and compare individual codes.
    - Resolve any discrepancies through consensus coding.
    - Create a unified codebook with agreed-upon codes and definitions.
- Coding Process
  - Apply codes systematically:
    - Both coders use the codebook to code the entire dataset.
    - Code line-by-line to ensure thorough analysis.
  - Assess intercoder reliability:
    - Compare coding between coders to ensure consistency.
    - Resolve any disagreements through discussion and consensus.
- Theme Development
  - Organize codes:
    - Group related codes together to identify potential themes.
    - Create hierarchies or thematic maps to visualize relationships between codes.
  - Identify themes:
    - Look for patterns and broader concepts that emerge from the grouped codes.
    - Develop clear definitions for each theme.
  - Review and refine themes:
    - Ensure themes accurately represent the data and address the research questions.
    - Combine, split, or discard themes as necessary.
- Finalization
  - Define and name themes:
    - Create concise, informative names for each theme.
    - Write detailed descriptions of each theme's scope and content.
  - Produce the final analysis:
    - Select vivid, compelling examples for each theme.

## System Prompt

As the orchestrator of the overall task, your job is to divide the overall task into subtasks and create as many agents as you need to complete each subtask. You will then compile the results of each subtask to produce the requested output
